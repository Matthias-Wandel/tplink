This is a very minimal python module for communicating with kasa tplink devices.
No external dependencies, basic communications code under 100 lines python

It's so short, half the time I just cut and paste the 100 lines that do the communications into whatever I'm programming, though it can also be used as a module.

I wrote this because most of the code I find out there for doing this sort of thing is far too complicated and has too many dependencies.  It doesn't need to be this complicated.

Am using this code with the following Kasa TpLink devices:

HS100 (Smart plug first generation)
HS110 (Smart plug first generation with power monitoring)
HS103 (Smart plug mini)
HS105 (Smart plug mini)
HS200 (Smart switch)
HS220 (Smart dimmer switch)
KP200 (Smart wall socket with two outlets)
KP115 (Smart plug mini power monitoring)
