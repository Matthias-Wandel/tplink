This is a very minimal python module for communicating with kasa tplink devices.
No external dependencies, basic communications code under 100 lines python

It's so short, half the time I just cut and paste the 100 lines that do the communications into whatever I'm programming, though it can also be used as a module.

I wrote this because most of the code I find out there for doing this sort of thing is far too complicated and has too many dependencies.  It doesn't need to be this complicated.
